# Zach-CSP2-Final-Project-
Final project for Csp2
This is my Portfolio page and my never ending project where I can test new coding techniques I learn. 
If you want to see what I know about frontend webdev this should be the first place you look
(Note 1:For know this project is in it's beta so theirs not much to see)
This project is built using HTML,CSS,JS,jQuery(JS Library),P5.js(Visual Library for js)
If possible I might use a slideshow library but for know I plan to code that myself
/////////////////////////////////
 If you find any issues or want to give your feedback please make a new issue and post it their
For now I don't plan on letting anyone else commit code for this project as it's just a solo personal project
